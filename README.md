**README**

I originally wrote my own NSDate extensions, but found out later that Erica Sadun had already covered most of the bases, and generally better than I had. Nonetheless, I had a few of my own methods that I wanted to preserve so I added them to my fork of her version, which is at https://github.com/erica/NSDate-Extensions
